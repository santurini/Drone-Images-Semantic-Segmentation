# Implementation

- The code was implemented in PyTorch using the [segmentation_models_pytorch](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch/tree/master/segmentation_models_pytorch) library
- To implement dataset augmentation it was used the [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/docs/api_reference/augmentations/transforms/) library
- To train the model it was used the [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai) framework 
- The models were ran on a Tesla P100 GPU on Kaggle
